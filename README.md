# Gridt

Display contents as a grid in the terminal. Works with matrixes (slices of slices), whose number of cells, columns and rows are well-defined, and with lists (slices) that still need to calculate the count of the columns and rows and the size of each item.

Inspired by [ogham/rust-term-grid][1].
